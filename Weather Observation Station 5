Weather Observation Station 5 HAKARRANK SQL

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, a
s well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). 
If there is more than one smallest or largest city, 
choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:


+-------------+------------+
| Field       |   Type     |
+-------------+------------+
| ID          | INTEGER    |
| CITY        | VARCHAR(21)|
| STATE       | VARCHAR(2) |
| LAT_N       | NUMERIC    |
| LONG_W      | NUMERIC    |
+-------------+------------+
Sample Input

Let's say that CITY only has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY

Sample Output

ABC 3
PQRS 4

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with 
the respective lengths 3,3,4  and 3 .
The longest-named city is obviously PQRS, 
but there are  options for shortest-named city; 
we choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

MY SOLUTION

SELECT city || ' ' || LENGTH FROM
(SELECT city , LENGTH(city) AS LENGTH FROM station WHERE LENGTH(city) =
(SELECT MAX(LENGTH(city)) FROM station) ORDER BY city ) WHERE ROWNUM <= 1
UNION
SELECT city || ' ' || LENGTH FROM
(SELECT city, LENGTH(city) AS LENGTH FROM station WHERE LENGTH(city) =
(SELECT MIN(LENGTH(city)) FROM station) ORDER BY city) WHERE ROWNUM <= 1;
