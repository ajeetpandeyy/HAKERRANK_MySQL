Weather Observation Station 9 _ SQL Question _ HackerRank
Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u)
as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

MY SOLUTION

select distinAct CITY from STATION where substr(UPPER(CITY),1,1) in ('A','E','I','O','U') and substr(UPPER(CITY),-1,1) in ('A','E','I','O','U');
